# Basketball Free throw corrector
We use YOLOV8 Pose model to extract shoulder, wrist, hip, femur and shin angles to train RNN based models to detect flaws in Basketball free throw shots.

You can find a Notebook thaat uses YOLOV8's pretrained pose model which extracts XY coordinates from a freethrow. The notebook further uses these coordinates to get the angles and train RNN based models to help detect flaws in the shots

You can find a report which in detail outlines the project, its scope and methodology in detail.
