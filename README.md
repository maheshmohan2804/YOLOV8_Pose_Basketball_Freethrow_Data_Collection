# Basketball Free throw Data Collection
In this is a Deep learning course project, we use YOLOV8 Pose model to extract shoulder, wrist, hip, femur and shin angles to collect data points to analyse data to understand flaws in the shot.

You can find a Notebook thaat uses YOLOV8's pretrained pose model which extracts XY coordinates from a freethrow. The notebook further uses these coordinates to get the angles. This data can be used for further analysis.

To run this notebook, please add the keypoint.py file into your current working directory and all your data points in google drive
